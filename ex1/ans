#What does "$<", "$^" and "$@" mean?
$< variable evaluates to the first prerequisite in the first rule for this target

$^ evaluates to the list of prerequisites of rules that have already occured for this target. 

$@ evaluates to the filename of the target and the target member name. 


#What does "$(shell find -name "*.c")" do?
It creates a variable containing all the filenames that end with .c in the particular folder the makefile is executed. 

#What is ".PHONY:"?
Is a defualt command. So that when you run make clean clean is not found as a file, and the makefile will default to the .phony statement. 


#What effect has the gcc-argument "-MMD, and how does it relate to the Makefile statement "include $(DEPS)"?
-MMD tells the compiler to generate Makefile dependency-information as a side effect of compilation. This information is stored in a dependency file, which has the suffix ".d" The "include $(DEPS)" tells Make to include the generated dependency file


#How does make determine which Makefile to use when "make" is run without arguments?
The make command will look for one of these makefiles: "GNUmakefile", "makefile", "Makefile" and execute them if found, in that order.
