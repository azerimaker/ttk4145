INITIALIZE ELEVATOR:

    Create datastructures 
        GLOBAL_GOING_UP = set()    # ARE THESE NEEDED?
        GLOBAL_GOING_DOWN = set()  # SEPERATE LISTS FOR EACH ELEVATOR?
        MY_GOING_UP = set()           
        MY_GOING_DOWN = set()         
        CURRENT_JOBS = set()     # the jobs this elevator can pick up on it's way to it's destination.   
        DIRECTION = ''          
        CURRENT_FLOOR = Do we get this from the driver?           
        STOP_NEXT = False
    
    GET OVERVIEW OF SYSTEM:
        - Broadcast "I'm here! This is me!"
        - Listen for other elevators that are online
        - If other elevators are online, add these to system overview
    
    START ELEVATOR:
        - Begin waiting for jobs
        - First job that arrives is added to CURRENT_JOBS
        - Broadcast this job to all other elevators and add to GLOBAL_LIST
        - Start moving in direction of first job
            * assume that when someone wants to go up or down, they want to go all the way to the top or bottom
            * if elevator at top, and floor in middle wants to go up, move down, do not pick up those going down
            * pick up people, start moving up and then take other jobs going up
        - Add each new job to GOING_UP or GOING_DOWN accordingly
        - Check list of current jobs to see if any can be done along the way
        - When elevator has reached top or bottom check for jobs going other direction
            * if at top, and no one wants to go up, choose job going up from lowest floor
        
        MONITOR OTHER ELEVATORS:
            - Listen for still-alive-messages
            - Update system overview with the time message is received from every elevator
            - If no message is received from elevator within a set time period, regard that elevator as dead
                * add dead elevators jobs to private list
                * remove elevator from list of elevators
            - Listen for other messages
                * OBSTRUCTION message - elevator is obstructed
                    - wait for a set time period, if elevator still obstructed, add jobs to own list
                    - continue to listen for messages
                * RUNNING message
                    - obstructed elevator works again
        
        IF OBSTRUCTED:
            - Broadcast "Unable to move!" for as long as obstruction lasts
            - When obstruction is cleared, clear list of jobs
            - Wait for new jobs
